# Quick Start Guide - CrewAI Multi-Agent System

## ✅ System Status: OPERATIONAL

All bugs have been fixed! The system is ready to use.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Verify LLM Connection
```powershell
cd "D:\Practice Lab-AI-Agent\Programming Assignment\CrewAI-multi-agent\crewai_multi_agent\src"
& "D:/Practice Lab-AI-Agent/Programming Assignment/CrewAI-multi-agent/crewai-venv/Scripts/python.exe" -m crewai_multi_agent.test_simple
```

✅ **Expected**: "LLM CONNECTION TEST PASSED"

### Step 2: Run Campaign Generator
```powershell
& "D:/Practice Lab-AI-Agent/Programming Assignment/CrewAI-multi-agent/crewai-venv/Scripts/python.exe" -m crewai_multi_agent.main
```

⏱️ **Duration**: 10-15 minutes

### Step 3: Check Output Files
Look for these files in the project directory:
- `campaign_validation_report.md`
- `amazon_campaign_final_report.md`

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Root Cause
❌ Gemini API 503 errors - "The model is overloaded"

### Solution
✅ Switched from experimental model to stable production model
✅ Added retry logic with exponential backoff
✅ Limited agent iterations to prevent hangs
✅ Added fallback model for high availability

---

## 📋 Key Changes

### 1. Model Configuration (`.env`)
```properties
# OLD (Unstable)
MODEL=gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-exp

# NEW (Stable)
MODEL=gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-001
FALLBACK_MODEL=gemini/gemini-2.0-flash
```

### 2. Agent Configuration (`crew.py`)
```python
# Added to all 6 agents:
max_iter=10,          # Prevents infinite loops
max_retry_limit=3,    # Retries on failures
```

### 3. Retry Logic (`main.py`)
```python
# Automatic retry with exponential backoff:
# Attempt 1: Immediate
# Attempt 2: Wait 10s
# Attempt 3: Wait 20s
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Successful Execution
```
✓ Primary LLM initialized: gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-001
🚀 Starting crew execution (Attempt 1/3)...
📋 Task: planning_task - Status: Executing Task...
🔧 Tool: Web Search Tool - Used successfully
✅ Task completed
```

### If API Overloaded
```
❌ Error: 503 - The model is overloaded
⏳ API overloaded. Waiting 10 seconds before retry...
🚀 Starting crew execution (Attempt 2/3)...
✓ Success on retry!
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Test fails with "Model not found"
**Solution**: Model name might have changed. Check available models:
```powershell
& "D:/Practice Lab-AI-Agent/Programming Assignment/CrewAI-multi-agent/crewai-venv/Scripts/python.exe" -c "import google.generativeai as genai; genai.configure(api_key=''); print([m.name for m in genai.list_models() if 'flash' in m.name.lower()][:5])"
```

### Problem: Still getting 503 errors after retries
**Solution**: API is genuinely overloaded. Options:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes and try again
2. Use lighter model: Change `.env` MODEL to `gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001`
3. Check your API quota at https://console.cloud.google.com

### Problem: Execution hangs on "Thinking..."
**Normal**: Agents can think for 1-2 minutes on complex tasks
**If stuck >5 minutes**: Press Ctrl+C and retry

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:
1. ✓ "Primary LLM initialized" message
2. 🚀 "Starting crew execution" without immediate errors
3. 📋 Tasks progressing through 7 stages
4. 🔧 Tools being used successfully
5. ✅ Two output files generated

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **First time?** Run `test_simple.py` first!
2. **Impatient?** Watch the terminal - you'll see progress updates
3. **Want different product?** Edit `main.py` inputs or use alternate functions:
   - `run_kitchen_appliance()`
   - `run_electronics()`
4. **Customize agents?** Edit `config/agents.yaml`
5. **Modify tasks?** Edit `config/tasks.yaml`

---

## 📞 Need Help?

1. **Check terminal output** - Errors are descriptive
2. **Run test utility** - `test_simple.py` identifies config issues
3. **Review detailed docs** - `BUG_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` has troubleshooting guide
4. **Verify API key** - Make sure it's valid in `.env` file
